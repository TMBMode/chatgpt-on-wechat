### Use with [TMBMode/BotPanel](https://github.com/TMBMode/BotPanel)
---
## What's Changed
- Organized config files within the `configs` directory (useful with multiple bots)
- Splitted system prompt from `config.json` to a separate `.prompt` file (for long prompts with line breaks)
- Added message tail (who knows why)

**Do not use this project directly. Use only with with BotPanel, or idk why you'll want to use it**
